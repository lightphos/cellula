Biomimicry of cell biology

Inspired by this book

## Genesis

Creates the nucleus
Creates the cell
Starts up the first cell

## Cell

Starts things off, with a nucleus

Note: **All** information in the cell is also in the nucleus...

### Self organisation

### Communication

### Packaging

### Replication

## Nucleus

Contains all the information - the dna

## DNA

Sets of code

Code assembly and deployment that behaves similar to living cells.

Cell nucleus is all the code (as in DNA).

Cell system that interprets and runs the code, cloning and deploying automatically.

## Code

Including cell, nucleus
Perhaps also the blueprint...

### Blueprint

Master code directs all things within the nucleus



## Go/Docker
Add GOPATH=..../
eg export GOPATH=/Volumes/Data/actualcode-software/
get docker.io --> not the best way but...
go get -d docker.io/go-docker
see https://github.com/docker/go-docker#dependency-management-tool-is-required

the code needs to sit in $GOPATH/src
